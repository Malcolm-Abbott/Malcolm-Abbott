### Hello there! 👋

### About Me 🙋‍♂️
I'm Malcolm Abbott, a trilingual web developer passionate about crafting interactive user interfaces using the PERN stack.

Constantly seeking new challenges, I'm on a mission to build more robust web applications while expanding my skill set.

Beyond coding, you'll find me pounding the pavement, training for my next big running challenge—an ultra marathon 🏃‍♂️.

## Fun Facts ⚡
* I lived in Sao Paulo, Brazil for 2 years and 4 months, in Santiago de Chile, Chile for 2 years, and in Bogota, Colombia for 2 years.
