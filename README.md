### Hello there! 👋

### About Me 🙋‍♂️
I'm Malcolm Abbott, a trilingual web developer passionate about crafting interactive user interfaces using the PERN stack.
Constantly seeking new challenges, I'm on a mission to build more robust web applications while expanding my skill set.
Beyond coding, you'll find me pounding the pavement, training for my next big running challenge—an ultra marathon 🏃‍♂️.
